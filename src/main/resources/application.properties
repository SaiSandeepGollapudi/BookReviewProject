# it is required to create an application properties file with the profile name as follows application-{profile-name}.properties
#@value when we use this for username, value gets assigned at runtime so even if we assign another values in other parts of code only the value
# given in application.properties will be assigned after running the program
#we can create another application.properties after mvn packaging and give value in that file and that will take precedence over this file
# and we can give values dynamically at run time in close also then that will have highest priority
